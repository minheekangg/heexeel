          I've thought about us for a long, long time
          Maybe I think too much but something's wrong
          There's something here that doesn't last too long
          Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine
          Seeing you, or seeing anything as much as I do you
          I take for granted that you're always there
          I take for granted that you just don't care
          Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through
          It's important to me
          That you know you are free
          'Cause I never want to make you change for me
